  title="Comparing Theories of Human Behaviour by Implementing them in MARS Agents: An Interdisciplinary Approach Based on the HuB-CC Framework"
  author="Nima Ahmady-Moghaddam"
  type="ba"
  description="This thesis is concerned with the implementation of theories of human behavior as well as an agent architecture informed by domain expertise in an agent-based model written in MARS. A conceptual modeling framework called HuB-CC was used to identify, classify, and select the theories. The modeling approach was developed in an interdisciplinary exchange with the authors of the HuB-CC framework. The model results as well as the quality of the designed architecture are analyzed and potential avenues of further inquiry are explored."
