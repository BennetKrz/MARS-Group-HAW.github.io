The ESIDA kickoff meeting finally took place. With a delay of more than one year, nine ESIDA team members from Germany (University of Applied Sciences (HAW) Hamburg, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), University of Hamburg (UHH), and the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM)) made their way to the Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) to present first results and discuss next steps.
