The MARS Group is delighted to welcome Dr. Rebecca Sarku to the team! Rebecca is a postdoc researcher from Ghana with a background in geography and resource management. She joined the University of Applied Sciences (HAW) Hamburg via a prestigious scholarship awarded by the [Alexander von Humboldt foundation](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/). Her current research is focused on how artificial intelligence (specifically agent-based modelling) can be used to make grain and crop farming in West Africa more sustainable in the face of climate change.

An interview with Rebecca was published in German on the HAW website and can be read [here](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/detail/news/news/show/ich-vermisse-den-krach-das-hupen-das-tanzen/).
