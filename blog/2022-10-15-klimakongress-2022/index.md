How can we understand climate change better and find ways to respond to its impact? The Scientific Congress for High School Students is involved in research on all matters related to climate change. This year, the Klimakongress 2022 was hosted at the Technical University of Hamburg (TUH).

With more than 600 students, faculty members, and guests from the Hamburg metropolitan area, the event was a true success and gave an insightful glimpse into the possible responses to climate change from the scientific community.

The MARS Group was also represented at the event and held a workshop on agent-based modelling for traffic simulations as part of the presentation of the [Computer Science for Future (CS4F)](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/hochschule/technik-und-informatik/departments/informatik/unser-department/computer-science-for-future/) initiative.
