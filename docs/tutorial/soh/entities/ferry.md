# Ferry

The ``Ferry`` is a ``Vehicle`` that is used by the ``FerryDriver`` to commute between ``FerryStations`` on predefined routes called ``FerryLines``.

As right now, the ferry has only a capacity property for passengers (e.g. [MultiCapableAgent](../agents/multi_capable_agent.md)).

Further information can be found in the [FerryTransfer](../scenarios/ferry_transfer.md) scenario.
