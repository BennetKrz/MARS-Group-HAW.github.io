# Simple Live Visualization

The [MARS Simple Visualization](https://github.com/MARS-Group-HAW/mars-liveviz) is a small Python GUI to consume and visualize the [MARS WebSocket output](../configuration/sim_output_formats.md#real-time-websocket).

To get this visualization it is necessary to make a few adjustments in the `config.json`. The following describes how exactly the installation and execution works.

## Installation

The visualization tool can be found [here](https://github.com/MARS-Group-HAW/mars-liveviz). Please clone or download the repository and follow the installation instructions inside the README.

Once you have installed it and configured your model correctly you should be able to see your model in real-time.
