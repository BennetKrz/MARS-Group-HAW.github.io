# MARS Explorer

The MARS Explorer is an integrated development environment for creating and executing MARS simulations.


You can find the MARS Explorer source code and instruction on how to run it on [GitHub](https://github.com/MARS-Group-HAW/mars-explorer).

It includes the following features:

- Modelling *single-project* multiagent simulations
- Parametrization of agent and layer descriptions
- Executing simulations and viewing outputs in real-time

:::info
The MARS Explorer is recommended for your first steps in MARS and for smaller models. With growing complexity of your models, the MARS Explorer will not be powerful enough, we recommend using a *full* IDE then, see our [installation guide to MARS](installation.md).
